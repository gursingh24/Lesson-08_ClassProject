<!--var color=new Array("Red", "Green", "Blue"); these are literal strings as text. 
var colors=["Red", "Green", "Blue"]; this is an even simpler method
            0       1       2

Array Elements

arrayname.length, this returns a number indicating how many elements are in the array

color.length, this line returns 3 because there are 3 elements in that array

ArraySort() and Reverse() methods

.sort organizes elements into ascending order from A-Z

.reverse reverse whatever order elements happen to be in it at the moment.

if you apply .reverse, right after .sort, you'll get descending order Z-A

for Loops

provides a means of repeating a loop a predetermined number of times, while at the same time Incrementing (increasing) of decrementing
(decreasing) the value of some variable with each pass through the loop. simple english a loop can:

-count from up to any number
-count forward or backwards
-start at any number and end at any number

for (start; condition; increment) {
    code to be executed
}


while loops

these loops repeat one or more lines of code as long as some condition remains true. this does not need to be a counter with 
some incrementing number.

while and do while loops

while loops syntax is

while (condition) {
    code to be executed
}

do while

do {
    code to be executed
} while (condition)

the decision whether to repeat the loop is at the top of the while loop and at the bottom of the do while loop, in both syntaxes
replace the placeholders with your own information

condition: an expression that defines the"as long as" condition that determines when the loop stops repeating 

code to be executed: code to be executed with each pass through the loop

the main difference between the 2 loops is that the while loop might not repeat at all, but the do while loop is guaranteed to
repeat at least once. That's because with the while loop, the decision as the whether or not to do the statement inside the loop
is made at the top. 

Switch Statement

switch(value)
{
    case x1
    code to execute;
    break;
    case x2
    code to execute;
    break;
    ***
    default:
    code to execute;
}

ternary operators

usually to assign a value to a variable
condition ? return if true : return if false; 

condtion: this must be an expresion that evaluates to true or false.
return if true: the value returned ifthe condition is true
return if false: the value returned ifthe condition is false.

var age = 64
var admission = "Your cost: $" + (age < 60 ? "7.50" : "5.00"); 

We start by creating a variable named age, and we put a number in it. (In real life, the user might enter that number, 
or it may be determined through some other means.) Next, we create a variable named admission, which starts off as the string 
"Your cost: $". Then, added to that is either 7.50 or 5.00, depending on the value of age.

    If the age variable contains a value that's less than 60, then the admission variable receives the complete value "Your cost: $7.50".
    If the age variable contains a value that isn't less than 60, the admission variable ends up with the value "Your cost: $5.00".

so basically, the ternary operator does exactly what the if statement below does, it just does it with less code

var age = 64
var admission = "Your cost: $"
if (age < 60) {
    admission += "7.50"
} else {
    admission += "5.00"
}
